## What is the problem the group try to address?
Businesses usually use different kinds of software to do their day to day office activities, our group is trying to combine all those packages into one website. This will simplify and standardize businesses’ office operation, additionally computers are not necessary to install any software and can access it from anywhere.


## The proposed solution
A financial management web application that allows businesses to determine their weekly, monthly and annual income, which can then be used to determine a company's income and deficits. This information is crucial in allowing a company calculate their next logical step in growing as an industry. On top of the focus of financial management, it also will include applications for marketing and research, making it a simple pay as you go package for any company having all the application.


## Potential compatitors
Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Libre Office, InDinero, FreshBooks


## Issues
Applications may not be suitable to all requirements of each company that uses the applications, and number of possible applications businesses might require.
